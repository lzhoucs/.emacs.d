Yet another emacs config.

It is the emacs config that I use across multiple computers.

Right now it is very small, basic, but it will eventually go very large and hopefully professional.

To install,
```
git clone git@github.com:lzhoucs/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

Useful package but didn't include for now:
- https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens.  Built in electric-pair-mode seems good enough
- dimitri/el-get. Trying to find something better
- yasnippet. Will check out.
- js2-mode. Will check out.
